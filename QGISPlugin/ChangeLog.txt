Change Log
--------------------------------------------
Commit #15

Bug Fix: 	"Follow Behind" tab was disabled when all points were selected in active layer
Task:		Enabled audio to be attached to kml/kmz when the end is beyond the length of the the GPS track
Task:		Added datetime field. Populated on import with YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS
Task:		Changed all date and time references to point to the datetime field
Task:		Enabled the audio sync to populate the "audio" field without being in an edit session
Task:		Time tab. Edit selected time and before/after the selected time.

--------------------------------------------
Commit #16

Bug Fix: 	<TimeSpan> was defaulting to 5 seconds. Fixed to be 1 second.
Bug Fix:	<Camera> heading was 180 degrees off what it should be.
Task:		Added "relativeToModel" tag in the <altitude> for <Camera>. This means that the altitude will be relative to the 'altitude' tag in the <Model>, and that <Model> must be populated before attempting to use this setting.
Task: 		Added a yellow marker that indicates the selected point in an audio tour in QGIS

--------------------------------------------
Commit #17

Bug Fix:	On windows, "Description" field formats as "Descriptio". On MAC, it format to "descriptio". MM handles both now.

--------------------------------------------
Commit #18

Bug Fix:	Tab order on "Tour" tab.
Task:		Check box for presence of yellow indicator over selected point in audio sync.
Bug Fix: 	If audio start time matches exactly with time of first GPS point: a) we get no notification window (window that gives audio and track info), b) MM does not generate a 'play-head', c) the audio does not play automatically when you click the play button
Task:		"play" button is disabled when it is pressed. To enable it, press "stop" button.

--------------------------------------------
Commit #19

Bug Fix: 	Create <Camera> in the <document> before the <Tour> so that there are no strange camera actions.
Task:		Make the "Follow Behind" applicable to a selection of points rather than automatically selecting the whole track
Task:		Create a "smoother" field in "Follow Behind" tour so that the camera heading will take the mean angles of the points ahead of it.
Task:		Create a "follow angle" field in "Follow Behind" tour. This field is the angle between the point and the camera. This enables the user to place the camera anywhere (0-360 degrees) around the model.
Task: 		Suggest a tilt angle based on the altitude and range values. This auto populates.

--------------------------------------------
Commit #20

Task:		Allow for gaps in time in the <FlyTo> duration parameter. duration = time(n+1) - time(n)
Task:		Pre-populate last known folder directory, for all browsing dialog boxes.
Task:		Make the audio import file path the same as the export audio path.

--------------------------------------------
Commit #21

Bug Fix: 	The audio delay calculation was not firing since I was only inheriting the path from the import, rather than doind the calculation on the export tab.
