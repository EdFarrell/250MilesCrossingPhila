Change Log
--------------------------------------------
Commit #15

Bug Fix: 	"Follow Behind" tab was disabled when all points were selected in active layer
Task:		Enabled audio to be attached to kml/kmz when the end is beyond the length of the the GPS track
Task:		Added datetime field. Populated on import with YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS
Task:		Changed all date and time references to point to the datetime field
Task:		Enabled the audio sync to populate the "audio" field without being in an edit session
Task:		Time tab. Edit selected time and before/after the selected time.

--------------------------------------------
Commit #16

Bug Fix: 	<TimeSpan> was defaulting to 5 seconds. Fixed to be 1 second.
Bug Fix:	<Camera> heading was 180 degrees off what it should be.
Task:		Added "relativeToModel" tag in the <altitude> for <Camera>. This means that the altitude will be relative to the 'altitude' tag in the <Model>, and that <Model> must be populated before attempting to use this setting.
Task: 		Added a yellow marker that indicates the selected point in an audio tour in QGIS

--------------------------------------------
Commit #17

Bug Fix:	On windows, "Description" field formats as "Descriptio". On MAC, it format to "descriptio". MM handles both now.

--------------------------------------------
Commit #18

Bug Fix:	Tab order on "Tour" tab.
Task:		Check box for presence of yellow indicator over selected point in audio sync.
Bug Fix: 	If audio start time matches exactly with time of first GPS point: a) we get no notification window (window that gives audio and track info), b) MM does not generate a 'play-head', c) the audio does not play automatically when you click the play button
Task:		"play" button is disabled when it is pressed. To enable it, press "stop" button.

--------------------------------------------
Commit #19

Bug Fix: 	Create <Camera> in the <document> before the <Tour> so that there are no strange camera actions.
Task:		Make the "Follow Behind" applicable to a selection of points rather than automatically selecting the whole track
Task:		Create a "smoother" field in "Follow Behind" tour so that the camera heading will take the mean angles of the points ahead of it.
Task:		Create a "follow angle" field in "Follow Behind" tour. This field is the angle between the point and the camera. This enables the user to place the camera anywhere (0-360 degrees) around the model.
Task: 		Suggest a tilt angle based on the altitude and range values. This auto populates.

--------------------------------------------
Commit #20

Task:		Allow for gaps in time in the <FlyTo> duration parameter. duration = time(n+1) - time(n)
Task:		Pre-populate last known folder directory, for all browsing dialog boxes.
Task:		Make the audio import file path the same as the export audio path.

--------------------------------------------
Commit #21

Bug Fix: 	The audio delay calculation was not firing since I was only inheriting the path from the import, rather than doind the calculation on the export tab.

--------------------------------------------
Commit #22

Task:		The MM sync tab now behaves like GE. If there is a time gap between points, MM will continue to add time in the "Audio Clock Time" and "Duration Into Audio" time boxes. However, the FID box will stay static as well as the selected point on the map. These will again change, once the gps point timestamp matches the audio clock.

--------------------------------------------
Commit #22

Bug Fix:  	The 'camera' field exceeds the maximum character limit of 254 sometimes. This means that QGIS cuts of extra characters when saving as a shapefile. However, during and edit session the field will hold the extra characters. This allows a safe export in MM. There is no error in QGIS for the extra characters. The solution is to code all of the parameters. This brings the camera field down to about 180 characters.
Bug Fix:	The 'tilt' field needs only to autopopulate when it is empty, not when the user enters a value. This stops it from overwriting the user values.

--------------------------------------------
Commit #23

Bug Fix:	The custom camera function is was not fully obfuscating the camera dictionary. Result was writing the full dictionary, and it was still getting cut off by the 254 character limit.

--------------------------------------------
Commit #24

Task:		Create a <LookAt> tab in the Tour tab of Milk Machine. The <LookAt> tab has two modes; "custom" and "circle around". Both automatically calculate latitude and longitude. In custom mode, the user can select 1 or more points and apply a custom <LookAt> to each. If multiple points are selected, lat/long for each <LookAt> will be the lat/long of that point/model. In "circle around" mode, 1 or more points can also be selected. If multiple points are selected, MM calculates the geometric centroid of the selected points for the <LookAt> lat/long. If only 1 point is selected, it's lat/long will be the lat/long for the <LookAt>. "circle around" also has some parameter for customizing the number of rotations, starting heading, and duration.
Bug Fix:	After deleting points, the sync does not recognize the new point parameters. It needs to re-read the table and reset values based on edits that have taken place.
